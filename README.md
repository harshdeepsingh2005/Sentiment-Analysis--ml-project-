# Genetic Algorithm Sentiment Analysis

![Project Banner](./github-header-image.png)

## Overview

**Genetic Algorithm Sentiment Analysis** is a machine learning project focused on classifying text data into various emotional categories using genetic algorithms. The project provides insights into sentiment classification by leveraging optimized feature selection and model training. It is designed for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore the application of genetic algorithms in the field of sentiment analysis.

## Features

### Emotion Classification

- Classifies text into emotions such as:
  - **Happy**
  - **Sad**
  - **Anger**
  - **Fear**
  - **Surprise**
  - **Disgust**
- Implements optimized feature selection using genetic algorithms.
- Uses trained machine learning models for high-performance sentiment analysis.

### User Input Analysis

- Real-time emotion analysis for user-provided sentences.
- Displays probabilities for each emotion.
- Highlights the dominant emotion based on input.

### Model Performance Metrics

- Measures accuracy of the sentiment analysis model.
- Provides insights into the precision and reliability of emotion classification.
